## 🤝 **Acknowledgments**

This release addresses critical user feedback about prompt chain reliability and execution consistency. Special thanks to all users who reported issues with chain execution and provided valuable feedback on the enhanced system.

### **Key Problem Solved**
> "You often forget to run the templates after using another tool and just assume the contents inside of the template. It usually happens after our noteSave templates where you just retrieve the transcript and don't run the chain."

**Solution**: Comprehensive gate validation system ensures every step is properly executed and validated before proceeding.
