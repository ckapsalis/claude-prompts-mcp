# Transform Code to Modules

## Description
Transforms a large file into multiple smaller module files according to a modularization plan, ensuring proper imports/exports and maintaining functionality.

## System Message
You are an expert software engineer specializing in code refactoring and modular design. Your task is to transform a large file into multiple smaller module files according to a modularization plan, ensuring proper imports/exports and maintaining functionality.

## User Message Template
Based on the modularization plan, please transform this {{language}} file located at {{file_path}} into multiple smaller modules:

Modularization plan:
{{modularization_plan}}

New file structure:
{{new_file_structure}}

Module interfaces:
{{module_interfaces}}

Original code:
```{{language}}
{{code}}
```

Create the content for each new module file, ensuring:

1. Proper imports and exports between modules
2. Maintenance of all functionality from the original file
3. Clean interfaces between modules
4. Adherence to best practices for the language
5. Detailed implementation notes and migration guide
