## User Message Template
[System Info: You are an Obsidian vault integration specialist who excels at refining content while creating comprehensive knowledge networks. You understand Obsidian's advanced features including backlinks, tags, plugins, MOCs, and knowledge management systems.]

**SMART CONTENT REFINEMENT WITH OBSIDIAN INTEGRATION**

Refine and integrate the following content for optimal Obsidian vault utilization:

**RAW CONTENT:**
```
{{ raw_content }}
```

{% if vault_context %}
**VAULT CONTEXT:**
```
{{ vault_context }}
```
{% endif %}

**INTEGRATION LEVEL**: {{ integration_level | default('standard') }}
**TARGET READABILITY**: {{ target_readability | default('balanced') }}

**OBSIDIAN-OPTIMIZED REFINEMENT PRINCIPLES:**
- Create clean, readable content with intelligent vault integration
- Utilize advanced Obsidian features for knowledge management
- Build comprehensive backlink networks and tag systems
- Optimize for plugin ecosystems and advanced workflows
- Create discoverable, connected knowledge structures

**ADVANCED OBSIDIAN INTEGRATION PROCESS:**

## 1. CONTENT ANALYSIS & VAULT MAPPING
- Analyze content for key concepts and connection opportunities
- Map existing vault structure and identify integration points
- Plan comprehensive tagging and linking strategy
- Identify MOC (Map of Content) integration opportunities

## 2. INTELLIGENT BACKLINKING SYSTEM
- Create comprehensive [[WikiLink]] networks
- Establish bidirectional reference relationships
- Build conceptual connection hierarchies
- Optimize for knowledge discovery and navigation

**Backlinking Strategy:**
- **Primary Links**: Direct conceptual connections
- **Secondary Links**: Related topics and supporting concepts
- **Contextual Links**: Background knowledge and prerequisites
- **Progressive Links**: Learning pathway connections

## 3. ADVANCED TAGGING ARCHITECTURE
- Design hierarchical tag systems with nested structures
- Create domain-specific tag families
- Implement status and progress tracking tags
- Build searchable metadata systems

**Tag Categories:**
- **Domain Tags**: `#art`, `#perspective`, `#technique`
- **Skill Level Tags**: `#beginner`, `#intermediate`, `#advanced`
- **Content Type Tags**: `#methodology`, `#tutorial`, `#reference`
- **Status Tags**: `#active`, `#review`, `#mastered`
- **Connection Tags**: `#builds-on`, `#prerequisite`, `#related-to`

## 4. PLUGIN ECOSYSTEM OPTIMIZATION
- **Dataview**: Create dynamic queries and automated content aggregation
- **Templater**: Establish consistent formatting and metadata structures
- **Smart Connections**: Optimize for AI-powered relationship discovery
- **Graph Analysis**: Build meaningful connection networks
- **Spaced Repetition**: Integrate with learning and review systems

**Plugin Integration Examples:**
```dataview
TABLE file.mtime as "Last Modified"
FROM #technique AND #perspective
WHERE contains(file.name, "Figure")
SORT file.mtime DESC
```

## 5. KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT STRUCTURES
- **MOC Integration**: Connect to existing Maps of Content
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Layer information for different skill levels
- **Learning Pathways**: Create guided progression through concepts
- **Cross-Domain Connections**: Link concepts across different knowledge areas

## 6. ADVANCED OBSIDIAN FEATURES
- **Aliases**: Create alternative names for discoverability
- **Embedded Blocks**: Reference specific sections across notes
- **Canvas Integration**: Visual relationship mapping
- **Excalidraw Integration**: Diagram and visual concept mapping
- **Callouts**: Highlight important information and create visual hierarchy

**Enhanced Frontmatter:**

## 7. SMART CONTENT ORGANIZATION
- **Progressive Headers**: Clear hierarchy with consistent formatting
- **Embedded References**: Strategic use of `![[note#section]]` for content reuse
- **Contextual Callouts**: Important information highlighted with appropriate callout types
- **Cross-Reference Sections**: Dedicated areas for related content and connections

## 8. DISCOVERABILITY OPTIMIZATION
- **Search Optimization**: Content structured for effective vault search
- **Graph View Enhancement**: Connections that create meaningful graph relationships
- **Random Note Integration**: Content that adds value to random discovery
- **Daily Note Connections**: Integration with daily workflow and review systems
