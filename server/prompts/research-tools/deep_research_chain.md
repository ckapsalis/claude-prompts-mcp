# Deep Research Chain

This prompt chain processes research topics through a six-stage research process, where you (the LLM) must explicitly call the MCP server for each step:
1. Initial Topic Exploration - Identifies key areas and questions
2. Research Planning - Creates a structured research plan
3. Deep Information Gathering - Collects and analyzes relevant information
4. Critical Analysis - Identifies key insights and patterns
5. Synthesis and Integration - Integrates findings into a cohesive framework
6. Research Report Generation - Creates a comprehensive research report

**ðŸ”„ CHAIN WORKFLOW**: Returns a comprehensive multi-step research process workflow that explores a topic in depth, identifies key insights, and synthesizes findings into a structured report.

**âš¡ EXECUTION REQUIRED**: This tool outputs a detailed research workflow with 6 sequential steps that YOU must execute in order. Each step builds on previous results.
