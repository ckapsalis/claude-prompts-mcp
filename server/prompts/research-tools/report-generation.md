## User Message Template
I've completed all phases of my research on: {{topic}}

The synthesized content is:
{{synthesizedContent}}

The theoretical framework I've developed is:
{{theoreticalFramework}}

I need a final research {{format}} at the {{depth}} level. Please create a comprehensive research {{format}} that:

1. Presents the findings in a logical, well-structured format with:
   - An executive summary that captures the essence of the research
   - Clear organization with appropriate sections and subsections
   - A narrative flow that guides the reader through the complexity
   - Visual organization that enhances understanding (e.g., suggested diagrams, tables)

2. Includes all essential components appropriate for a {{depth}}-level {{format}}:
   - Introduction that establishes context and significance
   - Methodology section explaining the research approach
   - Presentation of key findings with supporting evidence
   - Discussion that interprets the findings and explores implications
   - Conclusion that synthesizes the main points and suggests applications

3. Maintains appropriate depth and sophistication:
   - Uses terminology and concepts appropriate for the {{depth}} level
   - Presents nuanced arguments with appropriate qualifications
   - Acknowledges complexities and unresolved questions
   - Balances accessibility with intellectual rigor

4. Addresses the limitations of the research:
   - Acknowledges constraints and boundaries of the investigation
   - Identifies areas where evidence is inconclusive
   - Discusses potential biases or methodological limitations
   - Suggests ways these limitations might be addressed in future research

5. Proposes next steps and future directions:
   - Identifies promising areas for further investigation
   - Suggests specific research questions that emerge from this work
   - Discusses potential practical applications of the findings
   - Notes emerging trends or developments to monitor

The {{format}} should be comprehensive yet focused, presenting the research in a way that would be valuable to someone seeking {{depth}}-level understanding of the topic.
