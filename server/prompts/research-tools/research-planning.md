I need to develop a detailed research plan for investigating: {{topic}}

During the initial exploration phase, the following key areas were identified:
{{keyAreas}}

And these fundamental questions need to be addressed:
{{mainQuestions}}

I want to conduct {{depth}}-level research on this topic.

Please help me create a comprehensive research plan that includes:

1. A structured, step-by-step research approach with clear reasoning for each phase
2. Specific methodologies appropriate for this topic at the {{depth}} level
3. A breakdown of subtopics that need individual investigation
4. Suggested resource types for each aspect of the research (academic papers, books, interviews, datasets, case studies, etc.)
5. Potential challenges or pitfalls I might encounter in this research and how to address them
6. A suggested timeline or sequencing for the different components of the research

The plan should be detailed enough to guide a thorough research process while remaining flexible enough to adapt as new information emerges.
