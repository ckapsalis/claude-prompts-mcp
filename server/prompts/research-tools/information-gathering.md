   - Key theories and frameworks
   - Significant developments and milestones
   - Current state of knowledge and ongoing debates

2. For each subtopic, provide:
   - What types of primary and secondary sources would be most valuable
   - What specific data points or evidence would be most relevant
   - How the information from different sources might complement or contradict each other

3. Critical evaluation of the information landscape:
   - Areas where consensus exists vs. areas of significant debate
   - Potential biases or limitations in the available information
   - Gaps in the existing knowledge base that might affect my research
   - How different disciplinary perspectives might interpret the same information

The goal is to gather comprehensive information that will allow for deep analysis in the next phase. Please organize this information in a way that highlights connections between different subtopics and prepares me for critical analysis.
