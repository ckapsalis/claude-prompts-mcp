## Example

**Example Input Topic**: "Black Holes"

**Example Output**:

# Black Holes

Black holes are regions of space where gravity is so strong that not even light can escape. They are formed when massive stars collapse under their own gravity at the end of their life cycles.

## Formation of Black Holes

- Collapse of a massive star after a supernova explosion.
- Gravitational collapse leads to a singularity.

**Singularity**: The core of the black hole where density becomes infinite.  
**Event Horizon**: The boundary beyond which nothing can escape the gravitational pull.

### Types of Black Holes

1. **Stellar Black Holes**: Formed from the collapse of individual stars.
2. **Supermassive Black Holes**: Found at the center of galaxies and millions to billions of times more massive than stellar black holes.

|Type|Mass Range (in solar masses)|Location|
|---|---|---|
|Stellar Black Hole|3 - 100|Typically scattered in galaxies|
|Supermassive|Millions to billions|Galactic centers|

$$rs=\frac{2GM}{c^2}$$

Where $rs$ is the Schwarzschild radius, $G$ is the gravitational constant, $M$ is the mass of the black hole, and $c$ is the speed of light.

## Insights

- Black holes often emit significant radiation through **accretion disks**, bright collections of material spiraling into the black hole.
- They play a key role in galaxy formation and the distribution of matter in the universe.

### Tasks

- [ ] Study the concept of **event horizons**.
- [ ] Create a detailed diagram of **stellar black holes**.
